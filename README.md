# Node Share V2

Node Share enables fast, two-way file sharing over a local network using NodeJS, allowing you to transfer files or folders from a PC to a mobile device without internet data.

Modern laptops often lack USB ports, and those available are usually occupied. Node Share bypasses the need for USB or slow Bluetooth connections, making file transfer easy.

Many users connect their computers to mobile hotspots for internet. Node Share lets you transfer files or folders from your PC to your mobile device without needing cables. Unlike other apps (e.g., Zapya), Node Share supports transferring **multiple files** and **folders** at once.

## Download

Download the latest Node Share setup from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/rookie-engg/node-share-v2/releases).

## Prerequisites

- Ensure both devices are on the same network (e.g., connect your PC to your mobile hotspot).
- Allow Node Share access to both public and private networks in your network settings.

## Steps to Transfer Files

1. Connect both the PC and mobile device to the same network (e.g., a mobile hotspot).
2. Launch the Node Share app on your PC.
3. Use your mobile device to scan the QR code on the screen or enter the URL shown directly into your browser (not a search engine).
